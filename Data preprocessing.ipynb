Two days prior to admission,\\nshe was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to\\nadmission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain\\noxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on\\nlevofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and\\npresented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.\\n\\nIn the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was\\n100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this\\ndespite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.\\n\\nReview of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,\\nchills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,\\ngastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,\\npalpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:\\nChest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with\\nexertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally\\nrelated, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]\\ndemonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of\\npredicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of\\n67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator\\ntreatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with\\nbronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible\\nair flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive\\nventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home\\noxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on\\nsteroid taper or been intubated in the past.\\n2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]\\ndemonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2\\nsignal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres\\nas well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to\\nthe right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific\\nin etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic\\nmicrovascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of\\nthe normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major\\nvascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate\\nright maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left\\nmaxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal\\nthickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic\\nor some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally\\nnoted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella\\nturcica\".\\n3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]\\ngoing for four minutes with a rate pressure product of\\n10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence\\nof ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of\\nthe study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and\\na calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies\\nangina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.\\nAre alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.\\n4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.\\n5. Depression on Lexapro.\\n6.

Aspirin 81 mg q.d.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an\\neminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].  The\\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\\nlymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured\\nby loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory\\nphase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the\\nlung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\\nnondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower\\nextremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There\\nis a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the\\nlower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal\\nmental status and cognition.\\n\\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets\\n300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was\\nnegative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas\\nshowed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\\n\\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,\\nsegmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus\\nsegmental atelectasis.\\n\\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal\\naxis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subQ Heparin.\\n\\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.\\n4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d.\\n5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d.\\n6.

Over the past five\\n\\nyears she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.\\nIn\\n[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure\\ndue\\nto a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she\\nrequired\\nintubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked\\n\\nnarrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with\\ntracheomalacia.\\nShe subsequently underwent placement of two\\nsilicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the\\ntrachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of\\nchest\\npain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to\\n\\n[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy\\non\\n[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral\\nwall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the\\n\\nperipheral and central airways with complete collapse of the\\nairways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were\\nalso noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in\\nher\\nrespiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion\\nwith Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty\\n\\nwith mesh.

Per report, patient felt like this with\\nprior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible\\npneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with\\nthis. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram\\nstain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew\\nparainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on\\nsolumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no\\nevidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\\ncontinued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with\\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (&gt;18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had\\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\\ninterimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the\\n50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in\\nsputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was\\nbegun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3\\nmore days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4\\ndays, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.\\n.\\n# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG\\ntube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD\\nwhich revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach\\nbody, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was\\nnegative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat\\nEGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO\\npantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was\\nchecked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.\\nContinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI\\nbleeding (see above)\\n.\\n# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due\\nto hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on\\n[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient\\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted\\nfollowing the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved\\nto soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.\\n\\n# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\nDNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nAfter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n# Omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# Furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# Toprol XL 50 mg daily\\n# Lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# Folic Acid 1 mg daily\\n# Centrum daily\\n# Diovan 80 mg daily\\n# Trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# Melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] Aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# Albuterol neb prn\\n# Duoneb prn\\n# Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **]\\n# Zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# Synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# Lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Two days prior to admission,\\nshe was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to\\nadmission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain\\noxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on\\nlevofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and\\npresented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.\\n\\nIn the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was\\n100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this\\ndespite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.\\n\\nReview of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,\\nchills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,\\ngastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,\\npalpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:\\nChest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with\\nexertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally\\nrelated, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]\\ndemonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of\\npredicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of\\n67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator\\ntreatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with\\nbronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible\\nair flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive\\nventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home\\noxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on\\nsteroid taper or been intubated in the past.\\n2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]\\ndemonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2\\nsignal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres\\nas well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to\\nthe right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific\\nin etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic\\nmicrovascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of\\nthe normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major\\nvascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate\\nright maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left\\nmaxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal\\nthickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic\\nor some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally\\nnoted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella\\nturcica\".\\n3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]\\ngoing for four minutes with a rate pressure product of\\n10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence\\nof ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of\\nthe study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and\\na calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies\\nangina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.\\nAre alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.\\n4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.\\n5. Depression on Lexapro.\\n6.

Aspirin 81 mg q.d.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an\\neminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].  The\\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\\nlymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured\\nby loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory\\nphase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the\\nlung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\\nnondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower\\nextremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There\\nis a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the\\nlower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal\\nmental status and cognition.\\n\\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets\\n300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was\\nnegative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas\\nshowed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\\n\\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,\\nsegmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus\\nsegmental atelectasis.\\n\\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal\\naxis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subQ Heparin.\\n\\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.\\n4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d.\\n5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d.\\n6.

Per report, patient felt like this with\\nprior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible\\npneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with\\nthis. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram\\nstain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew\\nparainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on\\nsolumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no\\nevidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\\ncontinued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with\\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had\\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\\ninterimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the\\n50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in\\nsputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was\\nbegun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3\\nmore days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4\\ndays, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.\\n.\\n# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG\\ntube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD\\nwhich revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach\\nbody, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was\\nnegative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat\\nEGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO\\npantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was\\nchecked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.\\nContinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI\\nbleeding (see above)\\n.\\n# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due\\nto hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on\\n[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient\\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted\\nfollowing the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved\\nto soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.\\n\\n# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\nDNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nAfter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n# Omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# Furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# Toprol XL 50 mg daily\\n# Lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# Folic Acid 1 mg daily\\n# Centrum daily\\n# Diovan 80 mg daily\\n# Trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# Melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] Aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# Albuterol neb prn\\n# Duoneb prn\\n# Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **]\\n# Zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# Synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# Lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid\\nbone,\\nmeasuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent\\nstudy of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.\\n2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly\\nover the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].\\n\\n[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:\\nExpected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy\\nincluding\\nsubcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate\\npneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal\\nlobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence\\nof residual tumor on this non contrast CT.\\n\\n[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is\\nmoderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.\\nNo areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker\\nin situ, with correct lead placement.\\n\\n\\n[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal\\ncraniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable\\n3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage\\nwith/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in\\nappearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic\\nedema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to\\nassess for residual tumor/ interval change.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nPatient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy\\nfor mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntaken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.\\nShortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was\\ndone without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically\\nintact.\\nOn [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to\\nthe stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT\\nwith contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.\\nOn [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the\\nfloor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and\\ncleared for discharge home.\\nOn [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was\\nnoted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. His\\nother vitals were stable. Electrophysiology was consulted and\\nthey recommended increasing the metoprolol XL dose to 100mg\\nQday. The patient was kept overnight to monitor this new dose.\\nOn [**3-1**] her remained stable neurologically and hemodynamically\\ntherefore he was cleared for discharge.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\ncoumadin, keppra, toprol xl, diovan, zocor\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours)\\nas needed for pain.\\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\\n2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\\n3. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\\ntimes a day).\\n4. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every\\n6 hours) as needed for Pain or fever > 101.4.\\n5. valsartan 160 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\\n\\n6. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\\n(Daily).\\n7. levetiracetam 250 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID (2\\ntimes a day).\\n8. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient.

Monitored K\\nbut patient did not need it on floor.\\n\\n# CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did\\nreport some nause and cramping. She was not tolerating all 1.5L\\nin exchanges on discharge.\\n\\n# Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct\\n20.1 to 21.9. Likely due to chronic hemolysis consistent with\\nSLE&gt;\\n\\n#. Prior SVC thrombus: Physical exam with L arm swelling\\nconsistent with this. No flow limitations. INR 3.5 on ICU\\nadmission.

The patient was originally\\n   admitted to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**2141-9-18**] due to hypertensive urgency and right\\n   leg/hip pain. She had recently been discharged on [**2141-9-14**] for the same;\\n   she was also recently in the MICU on [**9-7**] for hypertensive urgency.\\n   This evening, she was noted by nursing staff to be less arousable. Her\\n   BP on routine vitals was in the 80s systolic. She was not responsive to\\n   voice per report. At that time, the medical floor team evaluated the\\n   patient. Due to concern for narcosis, she received naloxone 0.4 mg X 2;\\n   there was little improvement after the first dose of naloxone but\\n   patient was more arousable after the second dose. ABG demonstrated\\n   7.26/39/185. Potassium on this ABG was 6.8 (not hemolyzed). EKG did not\\n   demonstrate any change from baseline.She did not receive any treatment\\n   for hyperkalemia prior to transfer.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient.

There is severe symmetric left\\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional\\nleft ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is identified.\\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic\\nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and\\nno aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to\\nhigh cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral\\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\\nhypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears\\ncircumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic\\nsystolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient. Mild aortic regurgitation.\\nModerate pulmonary hypertension. Findings consistent with hyperrtophic\\ncardiomyopathy.\\n\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**], pulmonary\\nhypertension has developed (also present on the study from [**2140-5-20**]).\\nPericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\n\\n

She had recently been discharged on [**2141-9-14**] for the same;\\n   she was also recently in the MICU on [**9-7**] for hypertensive urgency.\\n   This evening, she was noted by nursing staff to be less arousable. Her\\n   BP on routine vitals was in the 80s systolic. She was not responsive to\\n   voice per report. At that time, the medical floor team evaluated the\\n   patient. Due to concern for narcosis, she received naloxone 0.4 mg X 2;\\n   there was little improvement after the first dose of naloxone but\\n   patient was more arousable after the second dose. ABG demonstrated\\n   7.26/39/185. Potassium on this ABG was 6.8 (not hemolyzed). EKG did not\\n   demonstrate any change from baseline.She did not receive any treatment\\n   for hyperkalemia prior to transfer. CXR also done which was notable for\\n   cardiomegaly and ? retrocardiac opacity (though similar to prior on\\n   [**9-11**]).\\n   .\\n   On my arrival to the medical floor, the patient was alert and\\n   responding to questions appropriately. BP in both arms 90/60s; oral\\n   temp was 92.7.

       "4  Chief Complaint:  hypotension, altered mental status\\n   HPI:\\n   Ms [**Known lastname 406**] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple\\n   admissions for labile hypertension now transferred to the MICU for\\n   hypotension and decreased alertness. The patient was originally\\n   admitted to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**2141-9-18**] due to hypertensive urgency and right\\n   leg/hip pain. She had recently been discharged on [**2141-9-14**] for the same;\\n   she was also recently in the MICU on [**9-7**] for hypertensive urgency.\\n   This evening, she was noted by nursing staff to be less arousable. Her\\n   BP on routine vitals was in the 80s systolic. She was not responsive to\\n   voice per report. At that time, the medical floor team evaluated the\\n   patient. Due to concern for narcosis, she received naloxone 0.4 mg X 2;\\n   there was little improvement after the first dose of naloxone but\\n   patient was more arousable after the second dose. ABG demonstrated\\n   7.26/39/185. Potassium on this ABG was 6.8 (not hemolyzed). EKG did not\\n   demonstrate any change from baseline.She did not receive any treatment\\n   for hyperkalemia prior to transfer. CXR also done which was notable for\\n   cardiomegaly and ? retrocardiac opacity (though similar to prior on\\n   [**9-11**]).\\n   .\\n   On my arrival to the medical floor, the patient was alert and\\n   responding to questions appropriately. BP in both arms 90/60s; oral\\n   temp was 92.7. She complained of feeling \"cold\" but denied any chest\\n   pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, leg pain, or burning with\\n   urination.\\n   Patient admitted from: [**Hospital1 54**] [**Hospital1 55**]\\n   History obtained from Patient, Family / [**Hospital 56**] Medical records\\n   Allergies:\\n   Penicillins\\n   Rash;\\n   Percocet (Oral) (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen)\\n   itching;\\n   Last dose of Antibiotics:\\n   Infusions:\\n   Other ICU medications:\\n   Other medications:\\n   Home Meds:\\n   Nifedipine 60 mg PO qhs\\n   Labetalol 900 mg PO tid\\n   Hydralazine 50 mg PO tid\\n   Clonidine 0.3 mg/hr patch qWED\\n   Vitamin D once weekly\\n   dilaudid PO prn\\n   benadryl prn\\n   lactulose 30 ml TID\\n   Aliskiren 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\n   Prednisone 5 mg daily\\n   calcitriol 1 mcg daily\\n   .\\n   Meds on transfer:\\n   calcitriol 1 mcg daily\\n   nifedipine CR 60 mg PO daily (last dose 1030 am on [**9-20**])\\n   hydralazine 50 mg PO q8h (last dose 1030 am on [**9-20**])\\n   lactulose 30 ml PO TID (refused)\\n   calcium carbonate 500 mg po 4x per day\\n   clonidine patch 0.3 mg/24hr qwed\\n   prednisone 5 mg po daily\\n   labetalol 900 mg PO tid (last dose 1030 am on [**9-20**])\\n   warfarin 2 mg po daily\\n   aliskiren 150 mg po bid (last dose 1030 am on [**9-20**])\\n   sodium bicarbonate 650 mg PO tid (refused)\\n   morphine 2-4 mg iv q4h prn last dose on [**9-19**] (total 8 mg on [**9-18**] and 2 mg\\n   on [**9-19**])\\n   morphine 15-30 mg PO q4h prn (last dose 30 mg po at 1100 am on [**9-20**];\\n   total dose 60 mg PO on [**9-19**] mg PO on [**9-18**])\\n   zofran (last dose 9/9)\\n   Past medical history:\\n   Family history:\\n   Social History:\\n   - SLE diagnosed at age 16 with arthritis; s/p treatment with\\n   cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate; currently on gradual prednisone\\n   taper (currently 5 mg PO daily)\\n   - CKD V due to lupus nephritis; formerly on HD from [**2137**]-[**2140**] but\\n   stopped one year ago; had a PD catheter placed 2-3 months ago but has\\n   not yet started PD and has not tolerated recent attempts at PD\\n   - left eye uveitis s/p enucleation and placement of glass prosthetic in\\n   [**2139**]\\n   - labile hypertension; history of seizures due to hypertensive\\n   emergency\\n   - history of SVC thrombosis on warfarin (hypercoagulable workup\\n   negative)\\n   - hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy\\n   - history of thrombocytopenia (?

tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

was\\nnegative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat\\negd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was\\nchecked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no stents.\\ncontinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for gi\\nbleeding (see above)\\n.\\n# nutrition: unable to pass ng without direct visualization due\\nto hiatal hernia. ir guided post pyloric ng tube was placed on\\n[**7-26**] for tfs and po medications. ng tube was pulled when patient\\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. speech and swallow were consulted\\nfollowing the patient's

[**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\ndnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nafter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nmedications on admission:\\n# omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# toprol xl 50 mg daily\\n# lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# folic acid 1 mg daily\\n# centrum daily\\n# diovan 80 mg daily\\n# trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# albuterol neb prn\\n# duoneb prn\\n# advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **]\\n# zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr\\nsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.\\n2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n4. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as\\nneeded for insomnia.\\n6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.\\n7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day.\\n8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:\\none (1) puff inhalation twice a day.\\n11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily.\\n14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily.\\n15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4\\ndays: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily.\\n16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po\\ndaily (daily).\\n17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day.\\n18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four\\n(4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for\\noversedation or rr&lt;12.\\n19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day\\nfor 3 days.\\n20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.\\n21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as\\nneeded for constipation.\\n22. humalog insulin sliding scale\\nplease use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on\\nsteroids.\\n\\n\\ndischarge disposition:\\nextended care\\n\\nfacility:\\n[**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**]\\n\\ndischarge diagnosis:\\nprimary:\\n1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation\\n2. respiratory failure with intubation\\n3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease\\n4. hypertension\\n5. anxiety\\n\\nsecondary:\\n1. coronary artery disease\\n2. hypothyroidism\\n\\n\\ndischarge condition:\\nmental status: confused -

beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\\ncontinued around the clock. tte revealed mild symmetric lvh with\\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (&gt;18mmhg), normal rv, and moderate\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. on [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. patient had\\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\\ninterimittenty hypertensive to sbp 200s and tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

was\\nnegative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat\\negd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was\\nchecked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no

[**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\ndnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nafter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nmedications on admission:\\n# omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# toprol xl 50 mg daily\\n# lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# folic acid 1 mg daily\\n# centrum daily\\n# diovan 80 mg daily\\n# trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# albuterol neb prn\\n# duoneb prn\\n# advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **]\\n# zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr\\nsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.\\n2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n4. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as\\nneeded for insomnia.\\n6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.\\n7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day.\\n8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:\\none (1) puff inhalation twice a day.\\n11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily.\\n14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily.\\n15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4\\ndays: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily.\\n16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po\\ndaily (daily).\\n17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day.\\n18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four\\n(4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for\\noversedation or rr<12.\\n19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day\\nfor 3 days.\\n20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.\\n21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as\\nneeded for constipation.\\n22. humalog insulin sliding scale\\nplease use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on\\nsteroids.\\n\\n\\ndischarge disposition:\\nextended care\\n\\nfacility:\\n[**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**]\\n\\ndischarge diagnosis:\\nprimary:\\n1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation\\n2. respiratory failure with intubation\\n3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease\\n4. hypertension\\n5. anxiety\\n\\nsecondary:\\n1. coronary artery disease\\n2. hypothyroidism\\n\\n\\ndischarge condition:\\nmental status: confused -

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

patient was initially managed on\\nsolumedrol 60 mg iv q8h, and was eventually tapered. with no\\nevidence of pneumonia on cxr and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\\ncontinued around the clock. tte revealed mild symmetric lvh with\\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmhg), normal rv, and moderate\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. on [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. patient had\\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\\ninterimittenty hypertensive to sbp 200s and tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

was\\nnegative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat\\negd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was\\nchecked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no stents.\\ncontinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for gi\\nbleeding (see above)\\n.\\n# nutrition: unable to pass ng without direct visualization due\\nto hiatal hernia. ir guided post pyloric ng tube was placed on\\n[**7-26**] for tfs and po medications. ng tube was pulled when patient\\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. speech and swallow were consulted\\nfollowing the patient's

[**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\ndnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nafter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nmedications on admission:\\n# omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# toprol xl 50 mg daily\\n# lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# folic acid 1 mg daily\\n# centrum daily\\n# diovan 80 mg daily\\n# trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# albuterol neb prn\\n# duoneb prn\\n# advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **]\\n# zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr\\nsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.\\n2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n4. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as\\nneeded for insomnia.\\n6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.\\n7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day.\\n8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:\\none (1) puff inhalation twice a day.\\n11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily.\\n14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily.\\n15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4\\ndays: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily.\\n16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po\\ndaily (daily).\\n17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day.\\n18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four\\n(4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for\\noversedation or rr<12.\\n19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day\\nfor 3 days.\\n20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.\\n21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as\\nneeded for constipation.\\n22. humalog insulin sliding scale\\nplease use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on\\nsteroids.\\n\\n\\ndischarge disposition:\\nextended care\\n\\nfacility:\\n[**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**]\\n\\ndischarge diagnosis:\\nprimary:\\n1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation\\n2. respiratory failure with intubation\\n3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease\\n4. hypertension\\n5. anxiety\\n\\nsecondary:\\n1. coronary artery disease\\n2. hypothyroidism\\n\\n\\ndischarge condition:\\nmental status: confused -

head: impression:\\n1. likely meningioma along the greater [**doctor first name 362**] of the left sphenoid\\nbone,\\nmeasuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent\\nstudy of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.\\n2. bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly\\nover the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].\\n\\n[**2-25**] ct head: impression:\\nexpected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy\\nincluding\\nsubcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate\\npneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal\\nlobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. no evidence\\nof residual tumor on this non contrast ct.\\n\\n[**2-26**] cxr: findings: the lung volumes are rather low. there is\\nmoderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.\\nno areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. right pectoral pacemaker\\nin situ, with correct lead placement.\\n\\n\\n[**2-28**] head ct /c contrast: impression: status post left frontal\\ncraniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable\\n3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage\\nwith/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in\\nappearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic\\nedema. stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. followup to\\nassess for residual tumor/ interval change.\\n\\n\\nbrief hospital course:\\npatient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy\\nfor mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntaken to the trauma icu post-operatively still intubated.\\nshortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was\\ndone without difficulty. at post-op check he was neurologically\\nintact.\\non [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to\\nthe stepdown unit. this did not happen due to bed shortage. a ct\\nwith contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.\\non [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the\\nfloor. decadron taper was initiated. he was seen by pt and\\ncleared for discharge home.\\non [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was\\nnoted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. his\\nother vitals were stable. electrophysiology was consulted and\\nthey recommended

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

patient was initially managed on\\nsolumedrol 60 mg iv q8h, and was eventually tapered. with no\\nevidence of pneumonia on cxr and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\\ncontinued around the clock. tte revealed mild symmetric lvh with\\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmhg), normal rv, and moderate\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. on [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. patient had\\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\\ninterimittenty hypertensive to sbp 200s and tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

was\\nnegative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat\\negd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was\\nchecked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no stents.\\ncontinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for gi\\nbleeding (see above)\\n.\\n# nutrition: unable to pass ng without direct visualization due\\nto hiatal hernia. ir guided post pyloric ng tube was placed on\\n[**7-26**] for tfs and po medications. ng tube was pulled when patient\\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. speech and swallow were consulted\\nfollowing the patient's

[**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\ndnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nafter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nmedications on admission:\\n# omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# toprol xl 50 mg daily\\n# lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# folic acid 1 mg daily\\n# centrum daily\\n# diovan 80 mg daily\\n# trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# albuterol neb prn\\n# duoneb prn\\n# advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **]\\n# zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr\\nsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.\\n2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n4. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as\\nneeded for insomnia.\\n6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.\\n7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day.\\n8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:\\none (1) puff inhalation twice a day.\\n11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily.\\n14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily.\\n15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4\\ndays: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily.\\n16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po\\ndaily (daily).\\n17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day.\\n18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four\\n(4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for\\noversedation or rr<12.\\n19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day\\nfor 3 days.\\n20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.\\n21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as\\nneeded for constipation.\\n22. humalog insulin sliding scale\\nplease use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on\\nsteroids.\\n\\n\\ndischarge disposition:\\nextended care\\n\\nfacility:\\n[**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**]\\n\\ndischarge diagnosis:\\nprimary:\\n1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation\\n2. respiratory failure with intubation\\n3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease\\n4. hypertension\\n5. anxiety\\n\\nsecondary:\\n1. coronary artery disease\\n2. hypothyroidism\\n\\n\\ndischarge condition:\\nmental status: confused -

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite cpap machine.  she was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest pt.  the nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\ndue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  a\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by dr.\\n[**first name (stitle) **] [**name (stitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\non [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  on the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\non [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the interventional\\npulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. cardiovascular:  the patient was ruled out for a mi.  she\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative cks x3.  she was continued on aspirin,\\nimdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. hypertension:  she was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. hematuria:  the patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to foley placement.  the foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  she had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. hyperglycemia:  patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  this\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. leukocytosis:  patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  as the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. for the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  this was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. hypothyroidism:  the patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. depression:  the patient was continued on lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  it is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subq heparin.\\n\\n11. sore throat:  the patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  this was treated\\nwith cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid (a solution\\ncontaining kaopectate, bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. communication/code status:  the patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. muscle weakness:  the patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by physical therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  however, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\non motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  it was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. speech/swallow:  the patient had a speech and swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\ndischarge condition:  the patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  she was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\ndischarge status:  the patient will be discharged to [**hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.

tachypnic to the\\n50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but\\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of\\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in\\nsputum samples. although it was felt that this likely\\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\\nafter 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's\\nfamily and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative\\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\\nwould not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\\nagain and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory\\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\\nfloor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with\\nnebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical\\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\\ndiuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\\nof anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her\\nbreathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was\\nbegun. the patient should continue prednisone 30

was\\nnegative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat\\negd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved\\ngiven abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable\\nwith no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the\\npatient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po\\npantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held.\\n.\\n# weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness\\nat the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and\\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was\\nchecked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and\\nphysical rehab.\\n.\\n# cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no

[**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\\nregarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed\\nalong with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's\\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\\ndnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family\\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that\\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\\ncomfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the\\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with\\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\\nafter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem\\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\\nokay to intubate.\\n\\nmedications on admission:\\n# omeprazole 20 mg daily\\n# furosemide 20 mg daily\\n# toprol xl 50 mg daily\\n# lipitor 20 mg daily\\n# folic acid 1 mg daily\\n# centrum daily\\n# diovan 80 mg daily\\n# trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\\n# melatonin 3 mg qhs\\n# [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily\\n# albuterol neb prn\\n# duoneb prn\\n# advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **]\\n# zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\\n# synthroid 100 mcg daily\\n# lexapro 20 mg daily\\n\\n\\ndischarge medications:\\n1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr\\nsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.\\n2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n4. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).\\n\\n5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as\\nneeded for insomnia.\\n6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.\\n7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day.\\n8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for\\nnebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as\\nneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.\\n10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:\\none (1) puff inhalation twice a day.\\n11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily\\n(daily).\\n13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily.\\n14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for\\n4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily.\\n15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4\\ndays: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily.\\n16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po\\ndaily (daily).\\n17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one\\n(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day.\\n18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four\\n(4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for\\noversedation or rr<12.\\n19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day\\nfor 3 days.\\n20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.\\n21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as\\nneeded for constipation.\\n22. humalog insulin sliding scale\\nplease use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on\\nsteroids.\\n\\n\\ndischarge disposition:\\nextended care\\n\\nfacility:\\n[**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**]\\n\\ndischarge diagnosis:\\nprimary:\\n1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation\\n2. respiratory failure with intubation\\n3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease\\n4. hypertension\\n5. anxiety\\n\\nsecondary:\\n1. coronary artery disease\\n2. hypothyroidism\\n\\n\\ndischarge condition:\\nmental status: confused -
